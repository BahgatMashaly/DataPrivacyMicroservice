Privacy by Design (PbD) has become an important aspect for organizations that deal with personal data as a result of increased data privacy regulations in recent years. It no longer remains as a mere principle. Instead, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) addresses PbD as a mandatory legal obligation for data controllers and processors that can be fined for non-compliance with data privacy regulations. It is a challenge for enterprise organizations to consider the PbD aspects for all enterprise systems due to the cost and effort. In this paper, we propose a practical solution that helps help the organizations to reduce the cost and efforts in order achieve regulatory compliance and bridge the gap between data privacy regulation requirements, on the one hand, and system architecture, and design, on the other hand.  The proposed solution depends on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and microservices architecture to build a practical software solution that complies with the PbD and GDPR principles
